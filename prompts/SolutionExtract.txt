Attached image shows a software architecture for the following PROBLEM. Extract the architecture from the image and Describe the system using a SDG as described below. 

An Service Dependency Graph (SDG) is a directed graph G=(V,E)

V = services, databases, LB, file system, users, task or a eventsource - vertices can be staeful or stateless  

E - a set of directed edges edge vi,vj represents that service vi depends on service vj 

This can be three types  

Sync - vi calls vj and wait for vj to respond ( usually a HTTP/ TCP call) 

Async - vi calls vj and continue ( no effect on failure) - usually a message broker call 

Event wait - vi wait for a response from vj  - usually a message broker call

We can use phi calculus to describe complex waits 

Edges may be types or API calls 

Let's think step by step. 

Identify users in the system 

Identify services in the system 

Identify databases in the system 

Represent their interactions as SDG. 

Users, tasks, and eventsources are only vertices that can have on input nodes and only output nodes 

Please provide the response SDG in JSON in the following from
